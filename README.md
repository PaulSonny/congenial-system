# Useful iOS Developer Links
<h1>Design</h1>
<a href="http://iosdesign.ivomynttinen.com/">iOS Design Guidelines</a>
<br />
Designing iOS apps can be difficult sometimes, but finding correct and up-to-date information about all of Apples’ devices shouldn’t be. These design guidelines will help any designer who’s building neat things for iOS get started within seconds.

<h1>Development</h1>

<h2>Plugins</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/kattrali/cocoapods-xcode-plugin">CocoaPods Xcode Plugin</a>
<br />
This plug-in adds a menu item for interacting with CocoaPods. Useful if you don’t like dropping to the command line.

<h2>Icons</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/AlexDenisov/FontasticIcons">Fontastic Icons for iOS</a>
<br />
An open source set of classes for utilizing icon fonts, such as <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> in your iOS app. Quickly and easily have an icon in whatever pixel dimensions you require. Since fonts by nature can be scaled up and down with ease, this makes a really nice way to ship & use your icons without having to export multiple versions for the sizes you require.

<h1>Deployment</h2>
<a href="http://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>
<br />
A free service, similar to Hockey App. We’ve used TestFlight with great success for easily distributing apps and collecting feedback from our users. My only wish is that they’d start charging for the service. Also includes analytics and crash reporting, but we don’t use those features.

<h1>Analytics</h1>
<a href="http://flurry.com/">Flurry</a>
<br />
Flurry gives you the numbers to have a realistic view.

<h1>Marketing</h1>
<a href="https://placeit.net/">Place It</a>
<br />
A great collection of high res photos of people using devices, but the screens are templates that you can insert your own screenshots into. Very cool, and great for displaying your app in a nice way on your website.
